# Code Of Conduct

RapidKit follows a respectful, inclusive, and professional collaboration model for everyone who
participates in the project spaces (issues, pull requests, discussions, and reviews).

## Our Standards

Expected behaviour includes:

- Being respectful in tone, feedback, and disagreement.
- Focusing on technical outcomes, not personal criticism.
- Welcoming contributors with different backgrounds and experience levels.
- Accepting constructive feedback and iterating in good faith.

Unacceptable behaviour includes:

- Harassment, intimidation, or discriminatory language.
- Personal attacks, trolling, or repeated hostile interactions.
- Sharing private information without explicit permission.

## Scope

This code of conduct applies to all project-managed spaces and interactions where someone is
representing the RapidKit community.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behaviour, open a private maintainer contact through the
repository maintainers and include:

- What happened
- Where it happened
- Relevant links/screenshots
- Any immediate safety concerns

Reports are reviewed promptly and handled with discretion.

## Enforcement

Maintainers may take any action they consider appropriate to protect the community, including
warning, temporary restriction, or removal of participation privileges.

## Attribution

This document is aligned with the Contributor Covenant principles and adapted for RapidKit's
community workflow.
